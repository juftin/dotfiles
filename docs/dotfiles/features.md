# âœ¨ Features

Installation and setup of the `dotfiles` project is the use of an opinionated set of
tools and configurations. These configurations are based on my personal preferences
and are designed to be sensible defaults for most users.

This project functions by symbolically linking the configuration files and directories
in this repository to their appropriate locations on your system. Some tools and
frameworks require that you clone the repository locally, this project uses git
submodules to manage these dependencies.

## Shell Configuration

### Zsh

the Z shell (zsh) is set up with a number of frameworks and plugins to make
your terminal experience more productive and enjoyable:

-   Frameworks and Themes

## Python

-   [uv] for managing Python versions and CLI tools

### hatch

-   Sensible defaults for `hatch`

??? note "ðŸ“„ hatch/config.toml"

    ```toml
    --8<-- "tools/hatch/config.toml"
    ```

## git

-   Reasonable settings at `~/.gitconfig`
-   Reasonable global gitignore at `~/.gitignore`
-   `gh` ([GitHub CLI]) for git auth and GitHub interactions

??? note "ðŸ“„ .gitconfig"

    ```shell
    --8<-- "git/.gitconfig"
    ```

??? note "ðŸ“„ .gitignore"

    ```shell
    --8<-- "git/.gitignore"
    ```

## Neovim

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is a highly configurable, Vim-based text editor.
The configuration of Neovim is managed by the `dotfiles` project and is
configured with the [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
project template.

??? important "Neovim on Linux"

    Not all linux distributions have the latest version of Neovim available
    in their package managers. If this is the case, it is recommended
    to build Neovim from source to get the latest version. The `dotfiles`
    project has exposed a simple command to do this for you:

    ```shell
    dotfiles nvim-build
    ```

    Building Neovim from source requires a number of dependencies, which can be
    installed manually:

    === "apt-get"

        ```shell
        apt-get install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl build-essential
        ```

    === "yum (supports direct install)"

        ```shell
        yum install gcc gcc-c++
        yum install neovim
        ```

## Applications and Tools

-   [awsume] is an AWS role management tool configured with `dotfiles`. See the
    [awsume docs](../dev-setup/aws.md#awsume) in `dev-setup` for more information.

### macOS

A good number of macOS-specific applications are installed via Homebrew,
they're enumerated in the `macos/Brewfile` which is documented in the
[dependencies](../dotfiles/dependencies.md) section.

-   [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/) - installation of the
    [hammerspoon-shiftit](https://github.com/peterklijn/hammerspoon-shiftit)
    plugin which provides window management functionality. See the
    [shiftit docs](../dev-setup/apps.md#shiftit) in `dev-setup` for more information.

### Linux

Similarly, a good number of Linux-specific applications are installed via Apt,
they're enumerated in the `linux/Aptfile` which is documented in the
[dependencies](../dotfiles/dependencies.md) section.
