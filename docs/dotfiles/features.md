# âœ¨ Features

Installation and setup of the `dotfiles` project is the use of an opinionated set of
tools and configurations. These configurations are based on my personal preferences
and are designed to be sensible defaults for most users.

## Shell Configuration

### Zsh

the Z shell (zsh) is set up
with a number of frameworks and plugins to make your terminal experience more
productive and enjoyable:

-   Frameworks and Themes
    -   [ohmyzsh/oh-my-zsh] - The framework for managing your zsh shell
    -   [romkatv/powerlevel10k] - A powerful OhMyZSH theme and prompt
-   oh-my-zsh Plugins
    -   [oh-my-zsh/git] - Git aliases and functions
    -   [oh-my-zsh/dotenv] - Loads environment variables from `.env` for the current directory
    -   [oh-my-zsh/macos] - macOS-specific configuration for zsh
    -   [oh-my-zsh/z] - Tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'
    -   [oh-my-zsh/web-search] - Search the web from the terminal
    -   [oh-my-zsh/nvm] -nvm (the Node Version Manager) plugin
    -   [oh-my-zsh/asdf] - asdf (the extendable version manager) plugin
    -   [zdharma-continuum/fast-syntax-highlighting] - Syntax highlighting for zsh

they're enumerated in the `linux/Aptfile` which is documented in the
